This is the backup wizard.

You must complete the following requirements for the correct 
operation of this program:
1.- On the desktop of your work computer there should be a 
	folder called "Backups"
2.- In the storage unit there must be a folder called "My_Backups" 
	and it must not be a subfolder of any other.
3.- The required user (user_path) is the username of your computer.

You must remember the following:
1.- The letter of the storage unit (storage_unit) can change if you connect 
	several devices together, that is why it is required that you write 
	the letter every time you request to make a backup.
2.- The program will keep an account of three backups all the time inside the 
	storage device folder, when a new backup is created, the oldest backup 
	will be deleted.
